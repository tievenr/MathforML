Part 2

In the era of massive data accumulation, efficient storage and transmission of digital content such as images pose significant challenges. Compression techniques play a pivotal role in addressing these challenges by reducing the size of images while preserving their essential features. In this part of your assignment, your team is tasked with implementing and comparing multiple strategies for image compression without relying on in-built functions provided through libraries.

Participants are provided with two images of considerable size and are required to devise and implement two or more compression strategies. The goal is to reduce the size of the images while ensuring minimal loss of visual quality. Participants must explain the process behind each compression strategy and compare the effectiveness of the implemented techniques. When you receive the compressed image your next plan of action is to quantify the compression you have achieved. This involves utilizing two key metrics: Compression Factor and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Execute computations for each metric in separate notebook cells and furnish concise descriptions of the obtained results.
